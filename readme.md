</p>

### Fortified Silo World

The AI will build a *Planetary Shield Generator* and a mix of *Strongholds* and *Resource Silos* on this planet.

### Resource Silo World

The AI will build a *Planetary Shield Generator* and *Resource Silos* on this planet.

## Planet Automation
<p align="center">
    <img width="600" src="Github/industrial_on_farming_example.png" alt="Filled Districts">
</p>

Vanilla AI doesn't usually build (due to a technical restriction) other districs except the one that fits the designation best. So for example on *Agri-Worlds* it's only able to build *Farming Districts*. With this option, it will build the district of your choice on *Agri-Worlds* once all *Farming Districs* have been built. Keep in mind that this feature will mostly start being relevant in the Mid-Game (after the year 2300).

### Planet Decisions
<p align="center">
    <img width="" src="Github/decisions.png" alt="Planet Desicions">
</p>

With these planet decisions you are able to influence which districts the AI will build on the planet once it has finished its planet designation.

### Planet Automation
<p align="center">
    <img width="" src="Github/automation.png" alt="Planet Automation">
</p>

With the option "Fill Up Leftover Districts" you can enable/disable the feature globally.

## Compatibility
Currently not compitable with other mods that overwrite the following files:
- 00_farming_automation.txt

While i aim to overwrite as few vanilla files as possible some modifications can't be done otherwise. Still, with some additional changes to this mod no overwrites should be needed anymore.

## Limitations
- The AI cannot remove any districts nor buildings.
- The AI can only construct one type of district at a time.
