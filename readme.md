Vanilla AI doesn't usually build (due to a technical restriction) other districs except the one that fits the designation best. So on *Agri-Worlds* it's only able to build *Farming Districts*. With this option it will build *Industrial Districts* (currently limited to *Industrial Districts*) on *Agri-Worlds* once all *Farming Districs* have been built. This can be useful for nations with the civic *Catalytic Processing*.
